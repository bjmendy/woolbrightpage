 			<p>Woolbright are a special blend of emo with soulful prowess. Youthful and wise, the band are on the rise in the indie scene with features in <b>New Noise Magazine</b>, <a href="http://shoutengine.com/AngryGrrrlMusicoftheIndieRockPersuasion/">Angry Grrrrl Music of the Indie Rock Persuasion</a>, Miami New Times, <a href="http://www.southflorida.com/events/go-guide-blog/sf-go-guide-weekend-things-to-do-boca-femme-fest-20171108-story.html">SouthFlorida.com</a>, <a href="https://www.cltampa.com/music/show-previews/article/20993786/tampa-bay-live-music-february-25-2018">Creative Lofting</a>, Gems and Secrets and more. Described as "fuzzy" and "dreamy" in the stylistic tune of indie pop with an edge, Woolbright are not to be missed.

Buy tickets <a href="https://thefestfl.com/tickets/">here.</a> The band would love to chat with you about their upcoming shenanigans via tour and what they've been up to since their debut record Buzybody Lazybones and their holiday split from 2017.</p>

 			<h3>rock the house!</h3>
 				<p>
 					Following their first record, <i>Buzybody Lazybones</i> via <a href="www.whelmedrecords.com">Whelmed Records</a> with a tour and a spot at FEST 16, the Gainsville natives are equal parts <b>The Breeders, Pixies, Worriers and Thin Lips.</b>
 					Maritato's layered harmonies are reminiscent of <b>Into It. Over It.</b> with the personalization of a public diary; pouring heart and soul into each track, Woolbright emerge themselves in the moment.
<br>
Self described as <b>"smol rock"</b> and influenced by "life kicking me in the ass," Maritato draws inspiration from her favorite artists who have been in similar situations (haven't we all?).
<br>
<i>"Life kicking me in the ass is what really influences me," Maritato says. "More like my mental state kicking me in the ass. Hearing really honest and beautiful music like from artists like Catherine Vianale, Ben Gibbard, Max Bemis, Hayley Williams, and Julien Baker really makes me want to write [more]."</i>
